# Lost in squares

My submission to [2017 js13k game jam](http://2017.js13kgames.com/) with theme *lost*.

Your spaceship is lost in strange space. You must survive and escape. But first you need to retrieve four gems lost somewhere in this space. This won't be easy though, because hordes of enemy ships are coming to defeat the intruder and they will not accept gems to be easily lost. And your ship is not a battleship and cannot shoot.

Is there any hope left? Maybe, but probably not. All is lost.

This game uses awesome [ga](https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga) framework.
